## Method

__Opencv__ 
1. Detect and approximate polygons, assign ID to each polygon, overlay the IDs on the polygon in both the images and save them. 
2. Detect nodes/corners.  
3. Calculate number of nodes (```corner_count```) per polygon using euclidean distance.

__VLM (Gemini)__
1. Use ```corner_count``` and ```polygon_map_input_img.jpg``` (the image with nodes & labelled polygons) to generate a polygon ID to node number mapping ```node_dict``` with a single gemini call.
2. In the second call, Gemini uses ```node_dict``` and ```labelled_polygon.jpg``` image with colored & labelled polygons to answer user queries about nodes of any polygon.
